# DeleteGunEntity

Delete gun Entity for FiveM (work with a command)

### How it work ?

Just put in in your ressource folder and ensure it in your server.cfg
In game open chat and enter "/delgun on" for turn on and "/delgun off" for turn off

 Btw you must have permission to execute the command

I didn't test it so if you have error dm me : Î›zuka#1130
